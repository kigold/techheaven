I added a button to the Index page labelled "Add Article", it is just above "TECH LEADERS".

This button pops up a modal form that is used to create a new Article/blog.

The form has 3 fields namely, Title, Body and Upload.

to get all the articles in the database you use

tech/blog.php?id=*

which return an object of the article

to get a specific item article use

tech/blog.php?id=12

"12" being id of the article you want

This Data can now be displayed in the UI
